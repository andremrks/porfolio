I decided to create this page to practice things that i learnd and also to show what i can do and the projects i developed. 
This page has simple things in HTML, a lot in CSS and two functions in JavaScript. 
Basically this page contains most of the knowledge i have until now and i plan to learning and learning more every day and keep this page actualized with new projects, contents, effects and functionalities.
